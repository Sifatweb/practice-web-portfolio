    <h3>World-Class Professional Web Developer</h3>
    <P>I'm Sifat. I'm a Professional web developer. I spend my whole day,practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript; dabbling with Python & Ruby; & inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RS feeds. I build websites that delight & information. I do it well. I'm curious, & i enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new & stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes with tools well suited to the job at hand.</P>
